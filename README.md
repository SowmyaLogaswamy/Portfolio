## Description

_This project is a web page design of my portfolio. It contains details like my educational qualification, job experience, my interests and hobies and the reason why did I choose programming. It is my first test at Epicodus. I have used all the basic elements of HTML to design this web page. I have also included CSS for styling the web page and bootstrap framework for responsiveness of the webpage_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Create files using HTML_
* _Create a CSS file for styling_

* _fThen commit the code and push it to the hub_

_We should install atom editor, terminal, create github account, download bootstrap and css{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}_
