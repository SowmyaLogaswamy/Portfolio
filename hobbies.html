      <p>I 've been passionate about hobbies my whole life. I love Painting, learning, collecting,
        researching and developing new skills. Some of these skills have proven useful in my career,
        and some are just for me to enjoy.Today we're gonna talk about the private ones.
        The ones that make life better and help us
        decompress at the end of a long day.</p>

            <a href="https://www.cognizant.com/">https://www.cognizant.com/</a>
            <p>“Painting is just another way of keeping a diary.”
            This quote belongs to a very famous Spanish painter,
            Pablo Picasso.Art is something that I really like and painting is that I love doing the most.
            I absolutely agree with Picasso`s quote,
            in my opinion painting can help you express your things,
            feelings and is a pleasant pastime. I paint a lot of Canvas boards.</p>

            <a href="http://sproutwings.in">http://sproutwings.in</a>
            <p class="para">To begin with, many people go in for extreme sports, because other kinds of sports are too boring for them. There are different types
            of extreme sports: rock climbing, diving, rafting, snowboarding, parachuting and others.Parachuting is an unusual ,exciting occupation and adventurous sport. Imagines this scene
            :When you are flying, you feel freedom like a bird. Many doctors think that it helps to save people from stress and depression and
            it is a good way to lose weight. But if you have not learnt how to land, you can break your legs.
            Diving is a very adventurous sport. You will see a beautiful world under the water.
            But besides beauty, there are a lot of dangers. For example, you can meet poisonous sea creatures or even sharks! You can be poisoned by oxygen.
            Also, you can lose consciousness. As far as I am concerned nowadays our life is monotonous, and extreme sports give us an opportunity
            to make it more various. If I have the chance, I will certainly jump with the parachute. It will give me many positive emotions
            and I will never forget this amazing experience.</p>

            <h3>Cooking</h3>
            <a href="http://blazon.in">http://blazon.in</a>
            <p class="para">I love to cook and experiment with some products. It’s very funny and exciting.
            In my opinion, a lot of people like cooking but a very few people do it as a hobby,
            because you must have a passion towards food and you must be a foodie.
    T       o sum up, I believe that everyone needs some hobby to relax and in order not to waste
            time on unimportant and unnecessary things.</p>
