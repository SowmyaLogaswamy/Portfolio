    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I have always had a passion to become a good programmer from my childhood days.
      I started with learning programming from my school days.
      My first course was on Fundamentals of computing taught in our school
      My wow started when i realized that the sequences in movies that
      I saw were generated by a computer and were not real.
      From then on, I started realizing technology is ubiquitous in our lives.</p>
    <p>From maps to communicating with millions of people on the planet,
      to talking to loved ones on video call, technology touches the lives
      of billions of people on earth every day. Technology has touched almost all facets of my personality.
      I am interested in painting, photography, cooking and going out with friends.
      I use technology for everything i am passionate about - from photoshop for photo
      editing and using tools to preview how my final painting to planning our social events on facebook.</p>
    <p>In addition to every day scenarios, technology is changing the lives of a
      lot of under-privileged people and physically challenged people.
      It is hard to imagine technology without good computer programs ,
      even harder to imagine computer programs without good computer programmers.
      All the above scenarios are made possible by the hard work of millions of programmers.
      This is what inspires me to become a programmer.</p>
      <p>Being a programmer helps me create things that have not existed before.
        I am passionate about creating things that can improve the lives of under-privileged people in the world.
        I realized that becoming a good programmer needs a good understanding of fundamentals of a program and hence
        I went on to major in Computer science.</p>
      <p>My passion for technology and programming increased while i was in graduate school.
        From creating our own "Facebook" equivalent in our class to attending debugging competitions,
        workshops and presenting papers on computer science problems, the years spent in my graduate school
        helped me gain a good understanding of computer science and programming.
        Every river starts with a stream and every stream with a drop.
        I keep dreaming of the day when my small program would turn into something used by billions of people in the world</p>
