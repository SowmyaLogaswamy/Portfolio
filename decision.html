        <p>I have always had a passion to become a good programmer from my childhood days.
          I started with learning programming from my school days. My first course was on Fundamentals of computing taught in our school.
 I went on to do my bachelors in computer science and engineering where I attended courses that taught me core computer science and programming skills.
 Attending workshops like HackTrack on a variety of topics helped me get information from experts in the field.
 Playing with fun projects like PurpleBook (our class equivalent of facebook) made my interests deeper.
 I still remember the excitement we had when we could chat with each other in the class using PurpleBook.
 I worked under professor Kannan on wireless sensor networks. I completed my Bachelors in Computer science with a  distinction from Anna University.

 I have always been passionate about UX and hence joined blazon.in as a UI developer.
 I worked with UI designers to come up with web pages for our Vehicle management system .
 It was when I realized the importance of good UI and usability.

 I wanted to learn more about computer science and hence started my Masters in computer science
 under the guidance of Professor Hema. In addition to learning programming, I coached lab sessions and helped my juniors learn computer science skills .
 Our research on Ontology based data integration was published in reputed journals like IJERT, IJCSE, IRAJ and IEEE forum.
 More details on the research and
 publications can be viewed in my resume github gist.

 After completing my masters, I joined a startup called SproutWings to work on an Online Tenant Management system. The system helped tenants to setup and
 track maintenance requests, manage amenities and manage payment details. I was happy to see that I am using a system similar to OTMS after moving to the US.

 After my stint at Sprout Wings, I joined CTS as an Automation tester for Aim4A - the Agents portal for the Travelers insurance company.
 We used a variety of testing methodologies and automation testing tools like Selenium to maintain the quality of the Travelers
 insurance website.

 Though my tenure as a software engineer was cut short because I had to move to the US after my wedding to stay with my husband,
 I keep attending programming workshops, career fairs and networking events to stay updated on the current affairs of the computer industry.
 So joining Epicodus would be a great opportunity for me to start a slow ramp-up for a new phase in my programming career.</p>
